        Troop 6059 meets every Tuesday evening from 7:00 pm until 8:30 pm. We currently do not have a set location.

        However, we usually meet at the back of Access Academy on 1500 N. Mississippi St. in the Cafeteria. (formerly known as Kenner Hall). As of this moment, we are currently meeting at First Christian Church on Taylor Loop.
